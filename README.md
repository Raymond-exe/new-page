# Part 1: GitHub Basics

To start, make sure you have a [GitHub](https://github.com/login) account. We'll be using GitHub to store all files related to the website, and host the website itself as a [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) site.

<br>

Next, fork ***this*** repository (using the `Fork` button or clicking [here](https://github.com/Raymond-exe/new-page/fork)) and follow the naming convention below:

<details>
<summary>GitHub Pages naming convention</summary>

- If you name it `<USERNAME>.github.io`, your website will appear under the URL `<USERNAME>.github.io`
- If you name it `<ANYTHING>`, your website will appear under the url `<USERNAME>.github.io/<ANYTHING>`

As examples:
- [raymond-exe](https://github.com/raymond-exe)'s repository named **"raymond-exe.github.io"** will have the URL `https://raymond-exe.github.io`.
- The same user's repository named **"blackjack"** will have the URL `https://raymond-exe.github.io/blackjack`.
</details>

<br>

We'll be using the [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) application to skip needing to learn Git commands, but if you already have it or have the Git CLI set up you can skip this step. You can download GitHub Desktop [here](https://desktop.github.com).

<br>

Lastly, you'll need to copy **your** repository's files onto your computer using GitHub Desktop. Follow the short tutorial below if it's is your first time doing this:
