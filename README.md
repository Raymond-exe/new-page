# Part 1: GitHub Basics

To start, make sure you have a [GitHub](https://github.com/login) account. GitHub will help store all files related to our website, and host the website itself as a [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) site.

<br>

Next, fork ***this*** repository (using the `Fork` button or clicking [here](https://github.com/Raymond-exe/new-page/fork)) and follow the naming convention below:

<details>
<summary>GitHub Pages naming convention</summary>

- If you name it `<USERNAME>.github.io`, your website will appear under the URL `<USERNAME>.github.io`
- If you name it `<ANYTHING>`, your website will appear under the url `<USERNAME>.github.io/<ANYTHING>`

As examples:
- [raymond-exe](https://github.com/raymond-exe)'s repository named **"raymond-exe.github.io"** will have the URL `https://raymond-exe.github.io`.
- The same user's repository named **"blackjack"** will have the URL `https://raymond-exe.github.io/blackjack`.
</details>

<br>

We'll be using the [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) application to skip needing to learn Git commands, but if you already have it or have the Git CLI set up you can skip this step. You can download GitHub Desktop [here](https://desktop.github.com).

<br>

Lastly, you'll need to copy **your** repository's files onto your computer using GitHub Desktop. Follow the short tutorial below if it's is your first time doing this:

# Part 2: Webpage Setup

# Part 3: Content & Coding

Now that everything *else* is ready, we can begin writing code!

<br>

I recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) to write code thanks to its [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) plugin that allows us to preview the website as we code it, although any code editor should be able to work just fine.

If you're using VS Code, here's a tutorial on how to set up the Live Server plugin:

<br>

Go ahead and open this repository in your editor and open `index.html`. If this is your first time working with HTML, you can reference the [What is HTML?]() section above for help with HTML elements.

<br>

At this point you should be all set to create the website however you'd like, so everything below this line is mostly optional. If you won't be reading beyond this, you can delete both `example.html` and `images/crown.jpg`, but using these files we'll be making an example project portfolio website.
